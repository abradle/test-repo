overview:  Ox XChem is a two year project to enable the tools and culture needed for hit-to-lead in FBDD. Utilising the world leading X-ray fragment screening facility at Diamond (XChem) - Ox XChem aims to build three core areas. Computational tools to design follow-up compounds. Chemistry resource to make such compounds. Assays to provide rapid feedback from those compounds.
compchem: A computational chemistry resource @ Harwell for non-expert users will be available in Spring this year. Tools for selecting hits to follow-up on, enumerating and then scoring chemical libraries will be available. A core focus is integrating a wide-range of academic and commercial tools and working closely with pharma to create a national resource for computational chemistry.
synchem: Synthetic chemistry capabilities will be developed. A fragment library that is designed for follow-up chemistry is being developed. High throughput synthesis methods will be explored. A culture of engaging chemists with designing follow-up compounds will be developed.

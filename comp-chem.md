A computational chemistry resource @ Harwell for non-expert users will be available in Spring this year.
Tools for selecting hits to follow-up on, enumerating and then scoring chemical libraries will be available.
A core focus is integrating a wide-range of academic and commercial tools and working closely with pharma to create a national resource for computational chemistry.

Ox XChem is a two year project to enable the tools and culture needed for hit-to-lead in FBDD. Utilising the world leading X-ray fragment screening facility at Diamond (XChem) - Ox XChem aims to build three core areas. Computational tools to design follow-up compounds. Chemistry resource to make such compounds. Assays to provide rapid feedback from those compounds.
